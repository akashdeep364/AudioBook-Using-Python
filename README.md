# AudioBook Using Python

Reading comes under one of our daily habbit.

So, I think to create an audio book using python which can actually make reading by the machine of given input or pdf file.

Audiobooks  can be used  while walking or doing any other physical activity.

To make an Audiobook we just need 2 python libraries.
1. pyttsx3 -IT USED FOR TEXT TO SPEECH CONVERSION
 
2. PyPDF2  It  is  Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of extracting document information (title, author, â€¦) ,splitting documents page by page,merging documents page by page,cropping pages,merging multiple pages into a single page,encrypting and decrypting PDF files.


**A pdf file in the same folder in your Python Script.**
